# Configurator Ps CS6 Styles

_Please note that this project is no longer under active developement._

This set is an extension of Bootstrap to be used with the HTML widget. The styles will imitate the overall look and feel of Photoshop CS6 (including interface variations).

The styles are a subset of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and can easily used by any developer with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## Reference and Documentation

Documentation on how to use the styles can be found [on GitHub pages](http://thebitcave.github.io/configurator-styles-for-photoshop-cs6/).
